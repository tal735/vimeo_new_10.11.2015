OK: Exception caught and no longer appears. Works fine.

Generates unknown (to me) exceptions inside browser console at beginning of page load:

Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'ready' of undefined
  getCallback @ rtful_froogaloop.js:240
  onMessageReceived @ rtful_froogaloop.js:189

Everything works just fine. But the reason for the error is unknown at the moment.
